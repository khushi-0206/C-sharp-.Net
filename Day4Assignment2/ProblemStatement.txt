Problem Statement: Travel Ticket Booking & Fare Processing System
Design a Java program that simulates a travel ticket booking system. The program must validate passenger details,
calculate fare dynamically, apply discounts, and determine booking status using multiple decision structures.

Step 1: Passenger Input
• Passenger ID (int)
• Passenger Name (String)
• Age (int)
• Travel Type (int): 1-Bus, 2-Train, 3-Flight
• Base Fare (double)
• Is Government Employee (boolean: true/false)

Step 2: Age & Eligibility Validation (if / else)
• If age < 5 → Print 'Free Ticket – No Booking Required' and stop execution.
• If age > 80 → Print 'Medical Clearance Required' and stop execution.
• Else → Continue booking process.

Step 3: Travel Type & Class Selection (Nested Switch)
Bus: 1-Sleeper, 2-Seater
Train: 1-General, 2-Sleeper, 3-AC
Flight: 1-Economy, 2-Business
Step 4: Fare Multiplier Calculation
Travel      Type Class      Multiplier
Bus           Sleeper        1.2
Bus           Seater         1.0
Train         General        1.0
Train         Sleeper        1.3
Train         AC             1.6
Flight        Economy        2.5
Flight        Business       3.5

Fare After Class = Base Fare × Multiplier

Step 5: Discount Calculation (if-else-if + logical operators)
Apply discounts in the following priority order:
• Age ≥ 60 → 30% Senior Citizen Discount
• Else if Government Employee → 15% Discount
• Else if Age between 5 and 12 → 50% Child Discount
• Else → No Discount
Final Fare = Fare After Class − Discount Amount

Step 6: Booking Status (Nested Decision Making)
• If final fare ≥ 10,000:
• If travel type is Flight → Booking Status: Confirmed
• Else → Booking Status: Waiting List
• Else → Booking Status: Confirmed

Step 7: Display Ticket Summary
Display Passenger ID, Name, Travel Type, Class, Base Fare, Final Fare, Discount Applied, and Booking Status.

Note: Use meaningful variable names, proper indentation, and clear output formatting. Partial logic errors will
reduce marks.
